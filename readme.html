<h1>DS1621.py Readme</h1>

<p>Python library for Maxim/Dallas DS1621 I2C temperature sensor, originally written for Raspberry Pi's I2C-bus.  </p>

<h2>Functional description</h2>

<h3>Primary functions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Read temperature with 3 precisions  </li>
<li>Read high-resolution temperature (is one of the 3)  </li>
<li>Read &amp; verbosely report status register  </li>
<li>Set one-shot measurement mode  </li>
<li>Set continuous measurement mode  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Functions for the thermostat pin on the DS1621</h3>

<ul>
<li>Get thermostat setting from DS' non-volatile memory  </li>
<li>Set thermostat High and Low temperature  </li>
<li>Set thermohyst, same but with high temp and hysteresis  </li>
<li>Set thermoLOW makes thermostat pin active Low (1 = heater on)  </li>
<li>Set thermoLOW False makes thermostat pin active High (1 = cooler on)  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Assist functions for converting to and from the DS's register format</h3>

<ul>
<li>range is -55 to +125 degrees Celsius with .5 resolution  </li>
<li>data format is LSB MSB  </li>
<li>MSB is desired temperature in two's complement  </li>
<li>LSB is 0x80 for an additional .5 degrees.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>smbus  </p>

<h2>Additional stuff</h2>

<p>datalog.py is a simple script for taking and logging temperature readings. This is useful for calibrating a sensor.  </p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<p>Just for clarity, this is the chips pinout:  </p>

<pre><code>           _____  
    SDA - 1     8 - Vdd  
    SCL - 2     7 - A0  
   Tout - 3     6 - A1  
    GND - 4_____5 - A2
</code></pre>

<p>A DS1621 with address pins A2A1A0 = 000 (all tied to GND) will appear at <br />
bus address 0x48. Another DS1621 with A2A1A0 = 001 (A0 to Vdd) will be at <br />
0x49, and so on.  </p>

<p>Sensornames should be declared in the calling module, or in main(), for example:  </p>

<pre><code>Room    = 0x48  
Remote  = 0x49
</code></pre>

<p>Using RPi's GPIO (which includes I2C) requires root rights. Run the the driver with elevation like this:  </p>

<pre><code>$ sudo python DS1621.py
</code></pre>

<p>You can also run it with indirect elevation like this:  </p>

<pre><code>$ python sDS1621.py
</code></pre>

<p>However, in both cases, the user issuing that command must be member of sudoers.  </p>

<p>Somewhat tighter security is possible with <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/40106/2995">this workaround</a>. Essentially, you make the GPIO memory belong to group <code>gpio</code>, and then make your DS1621 user a member of <code>gpio</code> and <code>i2c</code>.  </p>

  <p>Check that /dev/gpiomem has the correct permissions.  </p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l /dev/gpiomem  
crw-rw---- 1 root gpio 244, 0 Dec 28 22:51 /dev/gpiomem
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it doesn't then set the correct permissions as follows  </p>

<pre><code>sudo chown root.gpio /dev/gpiomem  
sudo chmod g+rw /dev/gpiomem
